in .env file :

REACT_APP_AUTHORIZE_URL will be used to show authorize popup to access your Spotify 
account from your app.

REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL will be the URL where you want the user
to be redirected once the user is authorized successfully.
{Note that, the value of the REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL variable must match 
the value entered for the Redirect URIs in the Edit settings screenshot shown}

Each variable starts with REACT_APP_ so Create React App will automatically add those variables 
in process.env object to make it accessible in the application.
