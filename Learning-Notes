in .env file :

REACT_APP_AUTHORIZE_URL will be used to show authorize popup to access your Spotify 
account from your app.
****
REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL will be the URL where you want the user
to be redirected once the user is authorized successfully.
{Note that, the value of the REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL variable must match 
the value entered for the Redirect URIs in the Edit settings screenshot shown}
once we click on the AGREE button, weâ€™re redirected to the RedirectPage
component and Spotify will automatically add the access_token, token_type
and expires_in to our redirect URL as shown below.

(url...#access_token=BQAYA2X6Uwtbhf8PlvjKQhePSBXDcfzljSC9neFEXQOoe2SzWx_VXaVgoe_tvzUJpfGRvtwjlTq3ohlU0q6SVnJVyaiiwvl65aP2qDozRImCyU-vwn2We_8JnQVdPo5mv4TTlrbTqbOh8sA83_oW11AhHHEv92Y
&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600)

access_token is a Bearer token which you will be adding 
to every request made to the Spotify API later.
expires_in specifies the token expiration time which is 3600 seconds i.e 
in 1 hour by default. After that, you need to log in again.
****
Each variable starts with REACT_APP_ so Create React App will automatically 
add those variables in process.env object to make it accessible in the application.

Headers are an important part of the API request and response
as they represent the meta-data associated with the API request 
and response. Headers carry information for:
Request and Response Body

around HTTP connection types proxies etc
