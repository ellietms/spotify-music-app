-JSON.parse:
const result = JSON.parse(parses a string, written in JSON format)
result returns a JavaScript object.

-LocalStorage:
localStorage is a type of web storage that allows JavaScript sites 
and apps to store and access data right in the browser with no expiration date. 
This means the data stored in the browser will persist even 
after the browser window has been closed.

setItem(): Add key and value to localStorage
getItem(): Retrieve a value by the key from localStorage
removeItem(): Remove an item by key from localStorage
clear(): Clear all localStorage
key(): Passed a number to retrieve nth key of a localStorage


-JSON.stringify:(opposite of Json.parse)
common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.
When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string.
Convert a JavaScript object into a string with JSON.stringify().

-Slice(a,b):
array.slice(a) => it means cut all the values before index a and keep the index a
array.slice(a,b) => it means cut all the values before index a and keep them until index
b-1 (cut b)
